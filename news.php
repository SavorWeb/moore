				<h1>WASHLET SEATS</h1>

			<p>America seems to finally be catching up with our continental neighbors. Washlet seats have become an often requested upgrade to plumbing fixtures as they can combine the features of a bidet with your toilet. When space or budget does not allow for a bidet a Washlet seat is often the perfect solution. However many of us don't  know what a bidet is, or what it does. Back in the 1960's Arnold Cohen tried to market Bidets in America and soon realized that American's had never really heard of them and were wary of the odd looking things. In the 1980's Toto made a push for bidets here and received much the same reaction as Cohen did 20 years earlier. We seem to be warming to the idea of the Washlet seats though. Perhaps because they look less intimidating, like a really fancy toilet seat, right? Washlet seats do the same job a bidet does with a few extra features. I know many of you are curious about these  seats with as many features as most spa tubs come with. I get asked a lot of questions and, try as I might, they are hard to answer without a bit of red rushing to my face. With features like seat warmers, massage, air dry, bidet back, bidet front, spray adjustments from soft to hard, even music. Now is the music to relax you, or mask certain sounds?  I will let you decide! Because I don't know which feature will be the deciding factor for you, here is a YouTube video link that will help you see how each feature works and hopefully answer all of the questions that I wish you wouldn't ask.

I can tell you that our customers who own these LOVE them.  So if you are wondering what you might be missing in terms of improving your bottom line (pun intended), consider treating yourself to the luxury of a Washlet seat.</p>
