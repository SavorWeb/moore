				<blockquote>Years ago, we had a house full of girls - five to be exact - and so we installed two hot water heaters to keep everyone in hot showers. Now that the girls are grown and out of the house we wanted to do something different. Jim came and hauled out the two large hot water heaters and replaced them with a small wall mount instant hot water heater. It is fabulous! Two showers can be running at the same time and there is endless amounts of hot water. Thank you Jim for your prompt and efficient work.</blockquote>

				<blockquote>I have worked with Moore Plumbing Company for approximately 13 years and really appreciate the quality job they do every time.  As a custom home builder the relationship that my sub-contractor's build with my customers is as important to me as the relationship I build with my customers.  I find that Moore Plumbing represents me well as a General Contractor.   They work closely with my customers to select fixtures, keep track of changes and follow through on what they say they will do.</blockquote>
